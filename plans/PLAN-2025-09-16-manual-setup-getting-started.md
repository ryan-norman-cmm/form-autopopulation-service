# Implementation Plan: Manual Setup Getting Started Section

**Project**: Form Auto-Population Service  
**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**Type**: Documentation Enhancement  
**Scope**: Add manual configuration instructions for healthcare administrators

## Problem Statement & Context

### Current State

The existing README.md includes an excellent Quick Start guide that uses Docker Compose for automated setup, but lacks manual configuration instructions for healthcare administrators who need to set up FHIR clients, access policies, subscription topics, and subscription destinations manually in production environments.

### Healthcare Context

Healthcare organizations often require manual configuration of FHIR server components due to:

- Security policies requiring manual approval of access controls
- Compliance requirements for audit trails of configuration changes
- Integration with existing enterprise identity and access management systems
- Need for granular control over FHIR resource permissions
- Production deployment requirements that don't use Docker Compose

### Target Audience

- Healthcare system administrators configuring production FHIR servers
- Security officers setting up access controls and policies
- DevOps engineers deploying to enterprise environments
- Compliance administrators managing HIPAA-compliant configurations

## Solution Design

### Architecture Overview

The manual configuration section will provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the same components that are automatically configured in the Docker Compose setup, but adapted for production environments where manual control is required.

### Documentation Structure

The new "Manual Configuration for Healthcare Administrators" section will be added after the Quick Start section in the README.md and will include:

1. **Prerequisites and Environment Setup**

   - Production environment requirements
   - Security prerequisites
   - Network configuration requirements

2. **FHIR Client Configuration**

   - OAuth2 client creation in Aidbox
   - Scope configuration for healthcare workflows
   - Client credentials setup

3. **Access Policy Configuration**

   - Resource-level access policies
   - Role-based access control setup
   - Healthcare-specific permission patterns

4. **Subscription Management**

   - Manual subscription topic creation
   - Event destination configuration
   - Kafka integration setup

5. **Validation and Testing**
   - Configuration validation steps
   - Integration testing procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide

### Technical Approach

#### Existing Patterns Analysis

The codebase already contains configuration examples in:

- `/fhir-operator-config/clients.yml` - OAuth2 client configuration
- `/fhir-operator-config/subscription-topics.yml` - Subscription setup
- `/config/fhir-subscriptions.yml` - Event routing configuration

These existing patterns will be used as the foundation for manual setup instructions.

#### Simple Documentation Enhancement

This is a documentation-only change that:

- Adds a new section to the existing README.md
- Follows the established documentation patterns in the current README
- Uses the same tone and style as existing sections
- References existing configuration files as examples

### Risk Assessment

#### Low Risk Factors

- Documentation-only change with no code modifications
- Uses existing configuration examples as reference
- Follows established README structure and formatting
- No impact on existing functionality

#### Mitigation Strategies

- Review configuration examples for accuracy
- Validate manual setup instructions against actual Aidbox configuration
- Ensure healthcare compliance guidance is accurate
- Test readability and clarity with target audience

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Testing Strategy

Since this is a documentation enhancement, testing will focus on:

1. **Content Accuracy**: Verify configuration examples match actual system behavior
2. **Completeness**: Ensure all required configuration steps are covered
3. **Clarity**: Validate instructions are clear and actionable
4. **Healthcare Compliance**: Review guidance for HIPAA and FHIR R4 compliance

### Validation Criteria
